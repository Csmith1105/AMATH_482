%% Homework 1

% Using ultrasound, data is obtained concerning the spatial 
% variations in a small area of the intestines where the marble 
% is suspected to be. Unfortunately, the internal fluid movement 
% through the intestines generates highly noisy data.
% Locate and compute the trajectory of the marble.

% Through averaging of the spectrum, determine the frequency signature 
%(center frequency) generated by the marble.

Un = zeros(n,n,n,20);
Un_fft = zeros(n,n,n,20);
mean_fft = zeros(n,n,n); 

for j=1:20  % because we have 20 rows
   % Creates a 3D grid for each observation in Undata
   % this is the value of our function at each 
   % discretized point in space
    Un(:,:,:,j) = reshape(Undata(j,:),n,n,n); % stores the grid data 
  
    % transform the grid data to the frequency domain
    Un_fft(:,:,:,j) = fftn(Un(:,:,:,j));
   
    % uses the function values to transform to signal data
   % cumulative sum of signal values at each point in the grid
    mean_fft = mean_fft + Un_fft(:,:,:,j);
   
    % close all, isosurface(X,Y,Z,abs(Un),0.4)
   % axis([-20 20 -20 20 -20 20]), grid on, drawnow
   % pause(2)
end

% adjust this so that it corresponds to the indices
% of the Kx,Ky,Kz matrices, then take absolute value
% because we are interested in magnitude
mean_fft = abs(fftshift(mean_fft))/20;  

% vectorizes the matrix and get scalar max value
max_signal = max(mean_fft(:));  % 271.8673

% find the indices of the maximum value in the grid

% returns the linear index corresponding to the max value in mean_fft
[max_val, max_idx] = max(mean_fft(:))
% converts the linear index to corresponding x, y, z indices
[max_x, max_y, max_z] = ind2sub(size(mean_fft), max_idx);

% using the max coordinates, find frequencies associated with max signal
kx_center = Kx(max_x, max_y, max_z); % 1.8850
ky_center = Ky(max_x, max_y, max_z); % -1.0472
kz_center = Kz(max_x, max_y, max_z); % 0

% Filter the data around the center frequency determined above in 
% order to denoise the data and determine the path of the marble. 
% (use plot3 to plot the path once you have it)

% Since we have three different frequencies (in x, y, and z direction)
% for each point in the grid, we use the formula
% exp(-0.2*((kx - kx_0).^2 + (ky - ky_0).^2 + (kz - kz_0).^2); 
% where 0.2 is the tau value which is the width of our filter
% has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?
% I think the wider our filter, the more accurate the 
% signal in the time domain will be

filter = exp(-0.5*((Kx(:,:,:) - kx_center).^2 ... 
    + (Ky(:,:,:) - ky_center).^2 ... 
    + (Kz(:,:,:) - kz_center).^2)); 


% now multiply the fiter value grid and the unfiltered data grid

Un_fft_filtered = zeros(n,n,n,20);

   % converts the linear index to corresponding x, y, z indices
   % [max_x, max_y, max_z] = ind2sub(size(Un_filtered(:,:,:,j)), max_spatial_signal);
   
   % plot the signal data in the frequency domain
   close all, isosurface(Kx,Ky,Kz,abs(Un_fft_filtered(:,:,:,j)),0.4)
   title("Signal in Frequency Domain", 'Fontsize',18)

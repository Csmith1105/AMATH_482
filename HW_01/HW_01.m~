%% Homework 1

% Using ultrasound, data is obtained concerning the spatial 
% variations in a small area of the intestines where the marble 
% is suspected to be. Unfortunately, the internal fluid movement 
% through the intestines generates highly noisy data.
% Locate and compute the trajectory of the marble.

L = 15; % spatial domain
n = 64; % Fourier modes, i.e. # of points in spatial range (2^6)

% 1x65 vector, includes upper & lower bounds of spatial range [-15,15]
x2 = linspace(-L,L,n+1); 

x = x2(1:n); % each point in the discretized spatial range [-15,15)
y = x; 
z = x;

% wavenumbers (eigenvalues)
% 1x64 vector [[0,6.4926], [-6.7021, -0.2094]]
% scaling is 2pi/L  (why is code this 2pi/2L?)
k= (2*pi/(2*L))*[0:(n/2-1) -n/2:-1];

% 1x64 vector [-6.7021, 6.4926]
ks=fftshift(k);

% grid with spatial coordinates
[X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z);
% grid with frequency values
[Kx,Ky,Kz] = meshgrid(ks,ks,ks);

%% 1
% Through averaging of the spectrum, determine the frequency signature 
%(center frequency) generated by the marble.

avg = zeros(n,n,n); 

for j=1:20  % because we have 20 rows
   % Creates a 3D grid for each observation in Undata
   Un(:,:,:) = reshape(Undata(j,:),n,n,n);
   % uses the function values to transform to signal data
   signal = fftn(Un);
   % cumulative sum of values at each point in the grid
   avg = avg + Un;
   % close all, isosurface(X,Y,Z,abs(Un),0.4)
   % axis([-20 20 -20 20 -20 20]), grid on, drawnow
   % pause(2)
end


% still not totally sure what fftshift is doing here
avg = abs(fftshift(avg))/20;  

% vectorizes the matrix and get max value
max_signal = max(avg(:));  

% find the indices of the maximum value in the grid
[max_x, max_y, max_z] = ind2sub(size(avg), find(avg == max_signal));

% using the max coordinates, find frequency associated with max signal
max_freq_x = 


%% 2
% Filter the data around the center frequency determined above in 
% order to denoise the data and determine the path of the marble. 
% (use plot3 to plot the path once you have it)


%% 3
% Where should an intense acoustic wave be focused 
% to breakup the marble at the 20th data measurement?
